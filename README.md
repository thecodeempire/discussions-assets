# YOUR GITHUB IS HACKED

# A separate repo for all the major platform design, common assets (web components, logo, font etc.) and for major discussions.

## To start a new discussion simply create a new issue.

## To add some assets to the repo simply push changes. Try to make a new folder everytime you make a new **Web-Component**.

For understanding how to make a html-web-component. try to look into the **web-dev-simple-boilerplate**.
